Thank you for downloading my fonts^^


NON-COMMERCIAL USE
I consider “non-commercial” any school, research or charity project where you (or your client) are not earning money. Any other use is considered commercial.
 
If you’re going to use my fonts for non commercial projects, just write me a mail (nuraisyahamalia1729@gmail.com) telling me you’re using it.
If possible, include what for, and if you’re feeling generous, I’d love to see a sample of my fonts in action!

COMMERCIAL USE
For commercial use please donate via Paypal! (nuraisyahamalia1729@gmail.com)

The PayPal receipt proves the commercial license.

I recommend the donation sum is what you feel the font is worth to you and what you feel is right for what you’re getting from the fonts – I make less from doing this than you might think!

PLEASE
don’t sell my fonts or claim it as your own; don’t edit or rename my fonts; don’t redistribute my fonts.

Thank you for your support ^^
