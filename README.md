## Gameplay
   Move the snake down to eat the fruit. If the snake eats that fruit, it will receive points. On the contrary, if the snake eats an obstacle or plank, it will lose its life. When its life runs out, it loses.

### Mode 1: 1 Player
   The fruit will automatically fall. After you eat a certain number of points, the game will level up, by increasing the movement speed of fruits, obstacles and wooden boards.
### Mode 2: 2 Player
   The two-player mode will have one person dropping fruits and obstacles, and one person controlling the snake. The game will end if the snake controller runs out of lives.
